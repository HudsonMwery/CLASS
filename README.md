# CLASS
Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!). Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life! Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values. Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation. Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action
